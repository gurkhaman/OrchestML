# Test Composition Requirements

## Problem Statement
I need to build an automated image processing pipeline that can analyze uploaded photos and extract meaningful information.

## Requirements
1. **Image Enhancement**: Improve image quality and remove noise
2. **Object Detection**: Identify and locate objects in images
3. **Text Recognition**: Extract any text found in images (OCR)
4. **Classification**: Categorize images based on their content
5. **Summary Generation**: Create a structured report of findings

## Constraints
- Must handle common image formats (JPEG, PNG)
- Should process images up to 10MB in size
- Need real-time or near real-time processing
- Results should be returned in JSON format

## Expected Output
A composition that chains together multiple ML services to create a comprehensive image analysis pipeline with clear data flow between services.

## Use Case
This will be used for processing user-uploaded photos in a content management system to automatically tag and categorize images.
