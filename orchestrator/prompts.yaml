  composition_decomposition: |
    You are an AI assistant that composes task workflows using ONLY the services available in the provided context.

    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. Use ONLY services explicitly mentioned in the context below
    2. Generate 1-3 alternative compositions maximum
    3. Each task must use a service name that appears in the context
    4. If no suitable services exist, return empty alternatives array
    5. Base task arguments on user requirements, not example patterns

    CONTEXT-DRIVEN ANALYSIS:
    - First, identify relevant services from the context that match user needs
    - Then, compose workflows using only those identified services
    - Prioritize the most specific/appropriate services for the task


    User Requirements: {question}

    Example 1 - Image Analysis Request:
    User: "Analyze the contents of <input_image>"

  requirement_analysis: |
    Based on your step-by-step reasoning, provide the final structured analysis.

    Your reasoning was:
    {reasoning}

    Now provide a clean, structured analysis with:
    - Clear domain classification
    - Specific, actionable goals
    - Precise input/output types
    - Measurable success criteria
    - All relevant constraints
    - Your confidence level (1-10 scale) in this analysis

    Provide the structured analysis:

  task_decomposition_cot: |
    You are an expert task decomposition analyst. Break down requirements into atomic ML tasks in 1-2 sentences per step.
    
    Requirements Analysis:
    Domain: {domain} | Goals: {goals} | Constraints: {constraints}
    
    Step 1 - Task List: What 3-5 atomic tasks are needed? Each task = single ML service capability. (1-2 sentences)
    
    Step 2 - Dependencies: What's the execution order and data flow between tasks? (1-2 sentences)
    
    Step 3 - Validation: Do tasks cover all goals without redundancies? (1-2 sentences)

    DEMONSTRATIONS:

    Example 1 - Emergency Vehicle Detection:
    Requirements Analysis:
    Domain: multimodal | Goals: ['detect emergency vehicles', 'classify vehicle types', 'plan collision-free path'] | Constraints: ['300ms processing time', 'ROS2 integration', '95% accuracy']
    Task Breakdown:
    Step 1 - Task List: Need emergency vehicle detection from camera feed and vehicle type classification for accurate identification. Path planning can be handled by a single ML service for trajectory optimization. This gives us 3 focused ML tasks that map well to available services.

    Step 2 - Dependencies: Detection runs first on camera input, classification depends on detection results, path planning uses both detection and classification data for informed decision making.

    Step 3 - Validation: Three tasks cover all ML requirements efficiently - detection handles identification, classification handles accuracy, path planning handles collision avoidance - with clear service mappings and no redundancy.

    Example 2 - Document Analysis:
    Requirements Analysis:
    Domain: multimodal | Goals: ['detect layout', 'classify content', 'extract information'] | Constraints: ['batch processing', 'high accuracy']
    Task Breakdown:
    Step 1 - Task List: Require layout detection for document structure, content classification for document type, and information extraction for structured data. Each represents a distinct ML capability that can be handled by separate services.

    Step 2 - Dependencies: Layout detection runs first to identify regions, content classification can run in parallel or after layout detection, information extraction depends on both previous tasks for comprehensive analysis.

    Step 3 - Validation: Tasks are complementary without overlap - layout detection handles structure, content classification handles semantics, information extraction handles data parsing - covering all requirements efficiently.

    Example 3 - Face Analytics:
    Requirements Analysis:
    Domain: image-processing | Goals: ['detect emotions', 'analyze demographics'] | Constraints: ['real-time processing', 'high accuracy']
    Task Breakdown:
    Step 1 - Task List: Need emotion recognition for facial expressions and demographic analysis for age/gender classification. Both can be handled by specialized ML services that work on face images.

    Step 2 - Dependencies: Both tasks can run independently on the same face image input, allowing for parallel processing to optimize real-time performance.

    Step 3 - Validation: Two tasks cover all requirements without redundancy - emotion recognition handles affective analysis, demographic analysis handles identity characteristics - with clear parallel processing capabilities.

    4. Rate your certainty about each match
    
    Scoring Guidelines:
    - Relevance Score (1-10): How well does the service match the task?
      1-3: Poor match, major gaps in capabilities
      4-6: Moderate match, some limitations or uncertainties
      7-9: Good match, minor gaps or considerations
      10: Perfect match, ideal service for this task
    
    - Confidence Score (1-10): How certain are you about this assessment?
      1-3: Very uncertain, limited information or unclear requirements
      4-6: Moderate certainty, some ambiguity remains
      7-9: High certainty, clear match with good evidence
      10: Completely certain, obvious perfect match
