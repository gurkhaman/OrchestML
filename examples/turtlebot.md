I want a system that can control a TurtleBot3 to perform indoor deliveries.
It should listen to spoken commands, understand which recipient is being mentioned, and plan a safe path to reach them while avoiding obstacles and adapting to changes in its surroundings.
Once the person is detected and the objects delivered, the turtlebot must return to the origin spot.
The robot should be able to complete deliveries quickly and operate smoothly in real time without collisions or long delays.
